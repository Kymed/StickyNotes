Stickynotes!

By Kyle Meade

A simple web app where you can create sticky notes, add text to them, drag them around the page, and delete them.

An excercise to practice JQuery.

Developed all by myself (though had 1 stackoverflow post i got stuck on a small thing, needed a bit of help and couldnt find anything online or through test to solve it)

How to use it:

	- Double click anywhere to create a sticky

	- Click and drag the top bar to move the sticky around

	- Use "add text" and "backspace" buttons to manipulate sticky text

	- Press X button to delete the sticky
